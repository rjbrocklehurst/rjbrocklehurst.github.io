My previous post-doc at Harvard focuses on the evolution of the highly mobile and functionally diverse mammalian forelimb. Mammal forelimbs are highly diverse in terms of form and function - bats fly, sea lions & whales swim, gibbons swing, moles dig - the list goes on. The early ancestors of mammals, the non-mammalian synapsids, had a morphologically (and functionally) constrained forelimbs. Throughout synapsid evolution, several anatomical transformations occur within the forelimb, and these are well documented by the fossil record. However, we don't know precisely how these anatomical changes translated into functional ones. 

To answer these questions, I took a quantitative approach to the functional morphology and biomechanics of synapsids forelimbs. Creating musculoskeletal models of the forelimb of extinct and extant taxa, we can test changes in muscle function and joint range of motion through mammal evolution. Combined with data from experimental work on extant animals, and large-scale geometric morphometric analyses of limb bone shape, we will better understand the functional and evolutionary implications of anatomical transformations in the mammalian forelimb.
