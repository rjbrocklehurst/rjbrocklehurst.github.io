I'm an evolutionary biologist, biomechanist and vertebrate palaeontologist, trying to answer the perennial question; "how do animals work and why do they look like that?". I study links between skeletal form and animal function- feeding, breathing, locomotion- in both living and fossil vertebrates to better understand major transitions in vertebrate evolution. I use a combination of 3D models & visualizations, computational biomechanics, statistical shape analysis, and evolutionary comparative methods to answer a range of biological questions across the vertebrate tree of life.
